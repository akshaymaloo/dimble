// SectionGrouper.swift
// "Keep sections grouped" (docs/CORE-SETS.md, #80). Pelmet hides by
// membership and the bar's physical order is the truth, so an icon whose
// side of the chevron disagrees with its section (a relaunched app macOS put
// on the wrong side, an editor drop across sections: membership changed,
// nothing moved) looks fine collapsed and reappears on the wrong side at
// the next reveal, shifting the visible icons. This watches for those
// strays and relocates only them through the Apply door
// (`ApplyPass.Scope.strays`: input idle, cursor hidden, input suppressed).
//
// Only a stray Pelmet can explain is moved (`StrayLedger`): one newly seen,
// relaunched, or whose section changed while its side did not. An icon whose
// side flipped by hand (a user ⌘-drag BarAdoption could not read, a drop from
// another display) stays where the user put it. Never re-sorts within a
// section, never reads the pending editor `OrderEdits`. Bounded:
// `StrayBudget` allows two attempts per item and section, then the item is
// left to the editor's "not in place" badge and Apply. On by default; the
// escape hatch is the `pelmet.keepSectionsGrouped` bool (false = no
// synthetic drag outside Apply).
//
// The editor owns the order (vault plan "Dimble editor owns the bar order",
// 2026-10-20): with no stray left, the keeper (`keepOrder`, M3) puts icons
// that drifted from the editor's stored order back in their stored slots,
// through the same door (`ApplyPass.Scope.drift`). It waits for the drift to
// settle, keeps passes apart, and gives each icon two tries per stored order
// before leaving it to Apply. Pelmet's own extras come and go and are placed
// when they show, so of its own items only separators are kept.
//
// Logging: a state is logged once per change (`group: no strays`,
// `group: N stray(s) …`, `group: waiting — <why>`, `order: drift …`,
// `order: waiting — <why>`), so a blocked pass is never silent and a quiet
// bar is not noisy.
